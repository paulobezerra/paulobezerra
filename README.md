### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Paulo Bezerra, I work with software development since 2008. I work with several technicians such as: *Java*, *PHP*, *Python*, *JavaScript*. I know how to make frontend, backand applications and I have some experience with mobile development (Ionic and Kotlin).

Here I seek to leave applications that I made to study, lately I am looking to improve the documentation of these applications so that it can serve as an example for those who are studying and also as a portfolio.

*If this helps you in any way, you can disclose so that more people can be helped too.*

Outras tecnologias que conheÃ§o pelo menos um pouco:
* Backend: SpringBoot (Java), ExpressJS (NodeJS), Flask (Python)
* Frontend: Angular, ReactJS e VueJS
* Mobile: Ionic e Kotlin
* BD Relacionais: MySQL, PostgreSQL e SQL Server
* BD NoSQL: Redis e MongoDB
* DevOps: Docker, Kubernets, Jenkins, CicloCI.
* ExperiÃªncia com AWS e Azure.
