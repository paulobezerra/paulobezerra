# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Paulo Bezerra, I work with software development since 2008. I work with several technicians such as: *Java*, *PHP*, *Python*, *JavaScript*. I know how to make frontend, backand applications and I have some experience with mobile development (Ionic and Kotlin).

Here I seek to leave applications that I made to study, lately I am looking to improve the documentation of these applications so that it can serve as an example for those who are studying and also as a portfolio.

*If this helps you in any way, you can disclose so that more people can be helped too.*

## Other technologies that I know at least a little bit:
- Backend: SpringBoot (Java), ExpressJS (NodeJS), Flask (Python)
- Frontend: Angular, ReactJS and VueJS
- Mobile: Ionic and Kotlin
- Relational DB: MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server
- NoSQL DB: Redis and MongoDB
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernets, Jenkins, CicloCI.
- Experience with AWS and Azure.
